title: More blogs like this one
---

The idea to start a blog on science, research, and my journey to (and beyond!) grad school isn't new. Much of the design, content, and intention behind this site was inspired by the personal webpages of other, brilliant people whom I admire. I've catalogued some links to their work below:

## [Olga Botvinnik]
is a computational biologist and data scientist at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. She's also an alumnus of UCSD's Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program! Although her blog is less active these days than it was during her PhD, it's full of insightful and entertaining commentary. Topics range from navigating grad school to career development, metacognition/productivity, and various technical bioinformatics challenges. **Highlights:** *[How to fail (and sometimes win) at graduate fellowships] / [You can code, too!] / [Time is Citations: How I Plan My Days].*

## [Philip Guo]
is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science at UCSD. He studies human-computer interaction and theory behind how people learn to code. He's also a staggeringly prolific blogger, vlogger, and podcaster, with content that stretches back for decades and is still being updated almost daily. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of his written work, which covers a huge array of subjects, but his site's excellent organization and meticulously categorized posts make it easy to navigate. In particular, his advice for PhD students — both prospective and current — is among the best and most comprehensive that I've found anywhere. He's even published a 115-page memoir, "[The Ph.D. Grind]", detailing his experiences as a CS grad student at Stanford. **Highlights:** *[A Five-Minute Guide to Ph.D. Program Applications] / [Advice for Science Fellowship Applications: NSF, NDSEG, Hertz] / [Twelve Tips for Data-Driven Research] / [How I Learned Programming].*

### Note: more to be added soon!
