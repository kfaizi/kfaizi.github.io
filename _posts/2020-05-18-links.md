First, a thanks.

The idea to start a blog about science, research, and my journey to (and hopefully through!) grad school isn't new. Much of the design, content, and intention behind this site was inspired by the personal webpages of other, brilliant people who know much more than I do about many things.

To give credit where it's due, I've catalogued some links to their work below. Most combine excellent career advice with interesting technical tutorials. Some focus on a topic in a way I find uniquely compelling. All are fantastic resources. If you end up enjoying my content and want to find more like it, these are the next places I'd point you to (the list is unordered for a reason):

- **[Philip Guo]** is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science at UCSD. He studies human-computer interaction and programming education. He's also a staggeringly prolific blogger, vlogger, and podcaster, with daily content updates that stretch back for decades. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of his written work, which covers a huge array of subjects, but his site's excellent organization and meticulously categorized posts make it easy to navigate. In particular, his advice for PhD students — both prospective and current — is among the best and most comprehensive that I've found anywhere. He's even published a 115-page memoir, "[The Ph.D. Grind]", detailing his experiences as a CS grad student at Stanford. **Highlights:** *[A Five-Minute Guide to Ph.D. Program Applications] / [Advice for Science Fellowship Applications: NSF, NDSEG, Hertz] / [Twelve Tips for Data-Driven Research] / [How I Learned Programming].*
    - (6/8/20): This site is currently under renovation. If the above links are broken, try accessing them via the [Internet Archive].

- **[Lior Pachter]** is Bren Professor of Computational Biology at Caltech, where his lab develops tools for bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, such as <span class="inline-code">kallisto</span> and <span class="inline-code">bustools</span>. He's also a fierce advocate of [open science] and diversity in academia. However, he is perhaps best known in the scientific community for his vigorous, detailed takedowns of flawed science in his blog posts, which have at times provoked heated public disputes. Basically, he's not afraid to throw shade when he thinks it's well-deserved. He may be a controversial figure to some, but I think his commitment to good science is admirable. His efforts underscore the importance of open discourse and debate among scholars. Plus, his critiques are well-researched enough to merit serious consideration. **Highlights:** *[The perfect human is Puerto Rican] / [Technologies of narcissism] / [Diversity matters].*

- **[Tom Murphy]** is a Professor of Physics at UCSD, where he is also Associate Director of the Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences. When he's not testing General Relativity by [shooting lasers at the Moon], he raises awareness for issues surrounding societal growth, energy, and the environment. On his now-inactive blog, [Do the Math], he uses XKCD-style (i.e. Fermi-style, if that's more your style) physics estimations to demonstrate the gravity of our planet's predicament. And, before you sell your worldly possessions and become an ecoterrorist (I neither condone nor condemn this move), he also describes practical efforts you can make at home to massively curtail your consumption and help spread change. Alone, this won't save us — but it's a step in the right direction. The real tools here are the rhetorical ammunition: the quantitative arguments that we can use to help fight for real change. All of his posts are a masterclass in weaving calculations, narrative, and activism together in an accessible way. If I could, I would make them required reading for *everyone on the planet*. **Highlights:** *[Ruthless Extrapolation] / [Can Economic Growth Last?] / [Peak Oil Perspective] / [The Phantoms I've Killed] / [My Great Hope for the Future].*

- **[Jean Fan]** is an incoming Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins. Her lab develops machine learning algorithms for analyzing large datasets in the context of cancer biology. Alongside the thoughtful advice for grad students, my favorite parts of her blog are the
<span class="inline-code">R</span> tutorials. In these posts, she explores interesting real-world questions using basic modeling and web scraping. These curious tangents are creative, immediately accessible, and just fun to read. I think they're an awesome reminder of how we can use our scientific and technical expertise to help solve problems that matter to us, no matter the domain. Check them out for yourself, and get inspired by how much you can do with just a few lines of code and an internet connection! **Highlights:** *[Interactive Exploration Of The Gender Pay Gap] / [Data Driven Faculty Job Search] / [Online bargain-hunting in R with rvest].*

- **[Olga Botvinnik]** is a computational biologist and data scientist at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. She's also an alumnus of UCSD's Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program! Although her blog is less active these days than it was during her PhD, it's full of insightful and entertaining commentary. Topics range from navigating grad school to career development, metacognition/productivity, and various technical bioinformatics challenges. Her post about research fellowships is especially good. **Highlights:** *[How to fail (and sometimes win) at graduate fellowships] / [You can code, too!] / [Time is Citations: How I Plan My Days].*

- **[Michael Ernst]** is a Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, studying a wide range of topics related to programmer productivity. His [advice page] is a treasure trove for any student, even if it's understandably geared towards those with CS backgrounds. Topics include writing papers, applying for fellowships, and the job search. Although I have yet to explore it fully, I think these kinds of "wisdom repositories" are essential for society as a whole (basically, everyone should make one). **Highlights:** *[How to be a successful student] / [Applying to grad school] / [Collaborating with undergraduates effectively in research].*

My goal is to regularly add new names to this list, so be sure to check back often if you're interested in seeing more.
