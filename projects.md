# My Projects

**(under construction)**

My interests lie in **studying complex biological systems using quantitative and computational approaches**. I want to leverage this knowledge to engineer synthetic organisms to advance the health of people and the planet.

<!--Currently, I'm a lab technician in [Professor Wolfgang Busch’s group] at the Salk Institute. We study the genetics underlying root growth and root-environment interactions in plants, with a focus on the model organism _Arabidopsis thaliana_. A major goal of this research is facilitating crop engineering efforts to [fight climate change]. To aid root phenotyping tasks, I developed an image analysis tool. I'm also working on the network-based identification of functional homologs of genes driving root depth, based on coexpression analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.

Previously, I volunteered in the [lab of Dr. Patrick Hsu], where I helped develop tools for RNA editing using CRISPR-Cas13d. I wrote a pipeline for discovering new orthologs of Cas13d, and helped conduct a pooled transcriptome-wide screen to investigate guide RNA efficiency.-->
