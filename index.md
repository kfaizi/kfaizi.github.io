# Hi there! I'm Kian. :wave:

I’m a third year undergraduate at UC San Diego studying molecular biology, with a minor in math (emphasis on statistics). I intend to apply to PhD programs during the 2020-21 cycle. More [about me]{: fancylink}.

**Research interests:** quantitative systems biology, bioinformatics, synthetic biology, gene editing. Sometimes I [blog]{: tbd} about these ideas.

I currently work in a plant biology lab, where we're interested in how roots sense and respond to environmental stimuli. For more on my work so far, see [my projects]{: tbd}.

While you’re here, feel free to [view my CV]{: tbd}. You can also [get in touch]{: tbd} — I'm always interested in chatting about cool science!
