# [Hi there! I'm Kian.]

I’m a third year undergraduate at UC San Diego studying molecular biology, with a minor in math (emphasis on statistics).

I'm interested in studying complex biological systems using quantitative and computational approaches. My vision is to leverage this knowledge to engineer synthetic organisms to advance the health of people and the planet (sometimes I [blog] about these ideas). In pursuit of this goal, I plan to apply to PhD programs this fall.

I currently work in a plant biology lab, where we're interested in how roots sense and respond to environmental stimuli. For more on my work so far, visit my [projects] page. You can also learn more [about] my background.

While you’re here, feel free to [view my CV], or [get in touch] — I'm always happy to chat about cool science.
