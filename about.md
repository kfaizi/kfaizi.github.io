# About me :seedling:

I'm interested in studying complex biological systems using quantitative and computational approaches. My vision is to leverage this knowledge to engineer synthetic organisms to advance the health of people and the planet. In pursuit of this goal, I plan to apply to PhD programs this fall.

I'm a UCSD undergraduate and a lab technician in Professor [Wolfgang Busch’s group at the Salk Institute]. We study the genetics underlying root growth and root-environment interactions in plants, with a focus on the model organism _Arabidopsis thaliana_. A major goal of this research is facilitating crop engineering efforts to [fight climate change].

My work investigates the root system's response to mild deficiencies of essential nutrients. To aid root phenotyping tasks, I developed an [image analysis tool]. I'm also working on the network-based [identification of  functional homologs] of genes driving root depth, based on coexpression analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data.

Previously, I volunteered in the lab of Dr. Patrick Hsu, where I helped develop tools for RNA editing using CRISPR-Cas13d. I wrote a [pipeline for discovering new orthologs] of Cas13d, and helped conduct a [pooled transcriptome-wide screen] to investigate guide RNA efficiency.

Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking and writing bad poetry. I also have a keen interest in issues of environmental conservation, technology/data ethics, and science communication.
