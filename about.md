# About me
![headshot](/assets/headshot_web.jpg){: title="aoraki" id="headshot"}

My name is Kian Faizi, and this is my personal website. It's part blog, [part CV], and part brain dump. Thanks for stopping by.

I'm a student interested in studying complex biological systems using quantitative and computational approaches. I want to leverage this knowledge to engineer synthetic organisms to advance the health of people and the planet. In pursuit of this goal, I plan to apply to PhD programs this fall.

Currently, I'm a lab technician in [Professor Wolfgang Busch’s group] at the Salk Institute. We study the genetics underlying root growth and root-environment interactions in plants, with a focus on the model organism _Arabidopsis thaliana_. A major goal of this research is facilitating crop engineering efforts to [fight climate change]. Previously, I volunteered in the [lab of Dr. Patrick Hsu], where I helped develop tools for RNA editing using CRISPR-Cas13d.

Outside the lab, I enjoy hiking and writing bad poetry. I also have a keen interest in issues of environmental conservation, technology/data ethics, and science communication.
